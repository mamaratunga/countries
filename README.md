# Countries

## Overview

This project was created to meet requirements set for retreiving and displaying data about countries of the world. It showcases some Angular concepts including nested components, directives (attribute, structural), property binding (interpolation, property, event), Input/Output, use of HTTPClientModule, observables, services, dependency injection, and Angular Material components.

The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.4.

## Requirements

At a high level the web app should:

* Provide ability to view all countries
* Provide ability to list countries by region
* Provide ability to search for countries (partial or full name)
* Provide ability to get further details about a country by clicking on it in the list

## How to run the project from terminal

* Ensure npm and Angular are installed
* Retrieve the project from Github (`git clone https://github.com/mamaratunga/countries.git`)
* Navigate to local copy of repo (`cd countries`)
* Install node modules (`npm install`)
* Run application (`ng serve --open`)

Application should open on http://localhost:4200/

## Creating the application

**User Stories:** To Do

**UX/UI:** I have only used Bootstrap before, never Angular Material. I used this as an opportunity to learn and utilize Angular material for the components. Design and layout of the visual elements is usually my largest shortcoming (I typically rely on UX team for this). One of the items in the backlog is to use Angular Material and CSS to create a visually appealing layout.

## Backlog

Things I would like still like to complete:

* Handle Observables unsubscription or translate to Promises to avoid memory leaks
* Significant aesthetics overhaul (color, padding, spacing)
* Add testing
* Update README with User Stories
* Upgrade to Angular 10
* Responsive design
